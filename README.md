### Implementation Class Diagram

### Explanation
ðŸ‘‰ This implementation is designed with extendability and ease of use in mind.

ðŸ‘‰ The design accommodates a dynamic array of couriers through an abstract class that serves as a contract for newly integrated couriers. This enables our CourierDirector class to automatically select them if they align with the shipment properties.

ðŸ‘‰ The system manages each courier's capacity by setting a maximum shipment count, only presenting couriers that haven't reached their limit. This functionality is facilitated by an observer class that increments the current shipments of the courier when a new shipment is created, and decrements it when the order status is marked as completed.

ðŸ‘‰ The client can effortlessly opt for a specific courier or request the system to choose the most suitable one based on a diverse range of selection criteria, including:

- Support for both source and destination cities
- Compatibility with specific product types
- Ability to deliver before or on a specified due date
- Charges equal to or below a set amount
- Fastest delivery among the available options
- Most cost-effective option among the available ones.

Furthermore, extending these criteria is a breeze - adding a single function for each new criterion adheres to the Open Closed principle, ensuring our codebase remains neat and user-friendly, all thanks to our CourierBuilder pattern.
